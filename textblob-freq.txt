3:	24--In addition to quality health care, the north country's hospitals
provide jobs and revenue for surrounding communities.

reports by the Healthcare Association of New York State show just how far that
money goes.

using multipliers to show the ripple effect each dollar a medical center spends
has on its community.

for the local and state economies, or about 10 percent of the state gross
product, each year.

Center provided 2,090 jobs in 2006, with a payroll of $143,043,000.

country.

14:	That's a good thing."

15:	At Claxton-Hepburn Medical Center, employee dollars go a long way in the
Ogdensburg economy -- and the hospital helps the city attract businesses.

16:	The medical center paid its 710 employees $37,982,000 in 2006, according the
report.

17:	Dollars earned by hospital employees generated approximately $73,336,000
in economic activity for the Ogdensburg area.

recruiting prospective businesses," Ogdensburg Mayor William D. Nelson said.

21:	"It's a very large economic engine in the community.

22:	As the community grows, the
hospital does as well."

23:	Mr. Nelson, who works as vice president of support services for the hospital,
added that the physicians and medical staff recruited by the hospital contribute
to the city's character.

24:	"They bring new ideas, and many are involved with community boards.

25:	It brings a
whole spectrum to the community," the mayor said.

26:	Canton-Potsdam Hospital, Potsdam, also helps to entice professors and college
students to the north country.

care as a key part of where they go," said Richard D. Jacobs, the hospital's
vice president for finance.

28:	"We clearly provide a service as well as creating a
key part of the infrastructure of the community.

29:	As we grow and hire new
employees, they spend dollars that go in local employers' pockets."
